abstract = "MOTIVATION: Recently it has been shown that the quality ofprotein contact prediction from evolutionary information can beimproved significantly if direct and indirect information isseparated. Given sufficiently large protein families, the contactpredictions contain sufficient information to predict thestructure of many protein families. However, since the firststudies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we askhow much the final models are improved if improved contactpredictions are used. RESULTS: In a small benchmark of 15proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models areimproved by on average 33% using PconsFold compared with theoriginal version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find thatthe quality is improved with 15-30% when using PconsC incomparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further,using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improveglobal model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated withRosetta is improved. AVAILABILITY: PconsFold is a fully automatedpipeline for ab initio protein structure prediction based onevolutionary information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contactprediction and uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to itsmodularity, the contact prediction tool can be easily exchanged.The source code of PconsFold is available on GitHub at ̌e+https://www.github.com/ElofssonLab/pcons-fold+ under the MITlicense. PconsC is available from ě+http://c.pcons.net/.+SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics online."
