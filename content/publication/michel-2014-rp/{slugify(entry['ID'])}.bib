 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recently it has been shown that the quality of
protein contact prediction from evolutionary information can be
improved significantly if direct and indirect information is
separated. Given sufficiently large protein families, the contact
predictions contain sufficient information to predict the
structure of many protein families. However, since the first
studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we ask
how much the final models are improved if improved contact
predictions are used. RESULTS: In a small benchmark of 15
proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models are
improved by on average 33% using PconsFold compared with the
original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find that
the quality is improved with 15-30% when using PconsC in
comparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further,
using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve
global model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated with
Rosetta is improved. AVAILABILITY: PconsFold is a fully automated
pipeline for ab initio protein structure prediction based on
evolutionary information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contact
prediction and uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to its
modularity, the contact prediction tool can be easily exchanged.
