 abstract = {Predicting the biological function of molecules, be it
proteins or drug-like compounds, from their atomic structure
is an important and long-standing problem. Function is
dictated by structure, since it is by spatial interactions
that molecules interact with each other, both in terms of
steric complementarity, as well as intermolecular forces.
Thus, the electron density field and electrostatic potential
field of a molecule contain the ``raw fingerprint'' of how
this molecule can fit to binding partners. In this paper, we
show that deep learning can predict biological function of
molecules directly from their raw 3D approximated electron
density and electrostatic potential fields. Protein function
based on EC numbers is predicted from the approximated
electron density field. In another experiment, the activity
of small molecules is predicted with quality comparable to
state-of-the-art descriptor-based methods. We propose
several alternative computational models for the GPU with
different memory and runtime requirements for different
sizes of molecules and of databases. We also propose
application-specific multi-channel data representations.
With future improvements of training datasets and neural
network settings in combination with complementary
information sources (sequence, genomic context, expression
level), deep learning can be expected to show its
generalization power and revolutionize the field of
molecular function prediction.},
