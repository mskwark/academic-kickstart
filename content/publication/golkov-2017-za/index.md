abstract = "Predicting the biological function of molecules, be itproteins or drug-like compounds, from their atomic structureis an important and long-standing problem. Function isdictated by structure, since it is by spatial interactionsthat molecules interact with each other, both in terms ofsteric complementarity, as well as intermolecular forces.Thus, the electron density field and electrostatic potentialfield of a molecule contain the ``raw fingerprint'' of howthis molecule can fit to binding partners. In this paper, weshow that deep learning can predict biological function ofmolecules directly from their raw 3D approximated electrondensity and electrostatic potential fields. Protein functionbased on EC numbers is predicted from the approximatedelectron density field. In another experiment, the activityof small molecules is predicted with quality comparable tostate-of-the-art descriptor-based methods. We proposeseveral alternative computational models for the GPU withdifferent memory and runtime requirements for differentsizes of molecules and of databases. We also proposeapplication-specific multi-channel data representations.With future improvements of training datasets and neuralnetwork settings in combination with complementaryinformation sources (sequence, genomic context, expressionlevel), deep learning can be expected to show itsgeneralization power and revolutionize the field ofmolecular function prediction."
