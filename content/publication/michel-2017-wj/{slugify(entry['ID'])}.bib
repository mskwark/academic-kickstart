 abstract = {Motivation: A few years ago it was shown that by using a maximum
entropy approach to describe couplings between columns in a
multiple sequence alignment it is possible to significantly
increase the accuracy of residue contact predictions. For very
large protein families with more than 1000 effective sequences
the accuracy is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteins
as well as complexes. Today, for about half of all Pfam domain
families no structure is known, but unfortunately most of these
families have at most a few hundred members, i.e. are too small
for such contact prediction methods. Results: To extend accurate
contact predictions to the thousands of smaller protein families
we present PconsC3, a fast and improved method for protein
contact predictions that can be used for families with even 100
effective sequence members. PconsC3 outperforms direct coupling
analysis (DCA) methods significantly independent on family size,
secondary structure content, contact range, or the number of
selected contacts. Availability and implementation: PconsC3 is
available as a web server and downloadable version at
http://c3.pcons.net . The downloadable version is free for all to
use and licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.
At this site contact predictions for most Pfam families are also
available. We do estimate that more than 4000 contact maps for
Pfam families of unknown structure have more than 50% of the
top-ranked contacts predicted correctly. Contact:
