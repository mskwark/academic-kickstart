abstract = "Motivation: A few years ago it was shown that by using a maximumentropy approach to describe couplings between columns in amultiple sequence alignment it is possible to significantlyincrease the accuracy of residue contact predictions. For verylarge protein families with more than 1000 effective sequencesthe accuracy is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteinsas well as complexes. Today, for about half of all Pfam domainfamilies no structure is known, but unfortunately most of thesefamilies have at most a few hundred members, i.e. are too smallfor such contact prediction methods. Results: To extend accuratecontact predictions to the thousands of smaller protein familieswe present PconsC3, a fast and improved method for proteincontact predictions that can be used for families with even 100effective sequence members. PconsC3 outperforms direct couplinganalysis (DCA) methods significantly independent on family size,secondary structure content, contact range, or the number ofselected contacts. Availability and implementation: PconsC3 isavailable as a web server and downloadable version athttp://c3.pcons.net . The downloadable version is free for all touse and licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.At this site contact predictions for most Pfam families are alsoavailable. We do estimate that more than 4000 contact maps forPfam families of unknown structure have more than 50% of thetop-ranked contacts predicted correctly. Contact:arne@bioinfo.se.
