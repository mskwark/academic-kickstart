abstract = "Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are programs developedto rank protein models. These methods can be trained to predictthe overall global quality of a model or what local regions in amodel that are likely to be incorrect. In CASP8, we participatedwith two predictors that predict both global and local qualityusing either consensus information, Pcons, or purely structuralinformation, ProQ. Consistently with results in previous CASPs,the best performance in CASP8 was obtained using the Pconsmethod. Furthermore, the results show that the modificationintroduced into Pcons for CASP8 improved the predictions againstGDT_TS and now a correlation coefficient above 0.9 is achieved,whereas the correlation for ProQ is about 0.7. The correlation isbetter for the easier than for the harder targets, but it is notbelow 0.5 for a single target and below 0.7 only for threetargets. The correlation coefficient for the best local qualityMQAP is 0.68 showing that there is still clear room forimprovement within this area. We also detect that Pcons still isnot always able to identify the best model. However, we show thatusing a linear combination of Pcons and ProQ it is possible toselect models that are better than the models from the bestsingle server. In particular, the average quality over the hardtargets increases by about 6% compared with using Pcons alone."
