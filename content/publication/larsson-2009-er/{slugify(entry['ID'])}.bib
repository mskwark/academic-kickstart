 abstract = {Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are programs developed
to rank protein models. These methods can be trained to predict
the overall global quality of a model or what local regions in a
model that are likely to be incorrect. In CASP8, we participated
with two predictors that predict both global and local quality
using either consensus information, Pcons, or purely structural
information, ProQ. Consistently with results in previous CASPs,
the best performance in CASP8 was obtained using the Pcons
method. Furthermore, the results show that the modification
introduced into Pcons for CASP8 improved the predictions against
GDT_TS and now a correlation coefficient above 0.9 is achieved,
whereas the correlation for ProQ is about 0.7. The correlation is
better for the easier than for the harder targets, but it is not
below 0.5 for a single target and below 0.7 only for three
targets. The correlation coefficient for the best local quality
MQAP is 0.68 showing that there is still clear room for
improvement within this area. We also detect that Pcons still is
not always able to identify the best model. However, we show that
using a linear combination of Pcons and ProQ it is possible to
select models that are better than the models from the best
single server. In particular, the average quality over the hard
targets increases by about 6% compared with using Pcons alone.},
