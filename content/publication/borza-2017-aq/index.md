abstract = "Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinasethat binds to and is activated by collagens. DDR1 expressionincreases following kidney injury and accumulating evidencesuggests that it contributes to the progression of injury. Tothis end, deletion of DDR1 is beneficial in ameliorating kidneyinjury induced by angiotensin infusion, unilateral ureteralobstruction, or nephrotoxic nephritis. Most of the beneficialeffects observed in the DDR1-null mice are attributed to reducedinflammatory cell infiltration to the site of injury, suggestingthat DDR1 plays a pro-inflammatory effect. The goal of this studywas to determine whether, in addition to its pro-inflammatoryeffect, DDR1 plays a deleterious effect in kidney injury bydirectly regulating extracellular matrix production. We show thatDDR1-null mice have reduced deposition of glomerular collagens Iand IV as well as decreased proteinuria following the partialrenal ablation model of kidney injury. Using mesangial cellsisolated from DDR1-null mice, we show that these cells producesignificantly less collagen compared to DDR1-null cellsreconstituted with wild type DDR1. Moreover, mutagenesis analysisrevealed that mutations in the collagen binding site or in thekinase domain significantly reduce DDR1-mediated collagenproduction. Finally, we provide evidence that blocking DDR1kinase activity with an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitorreduces collagen production. In conclusion, our studies indicatethat the kinase activity of DDR1 plays a key role in DDR1-inducedcollagen synthesis and suggest that blocking collagen-mediatedDDR1 activation may be beneficial in fibrotic diseases."
