 abstract = {Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase
that binds to and is activated by collagens. DDR1 expression
increases following kidney injury and accumulating evidence
suggests that it contributes to the progression of injury. To
this end, deletion of DDR1 is beneficial in ameliorating kidney
injury induced by angiotensin infusion, unilateral ureteral
obstruction, or nephrotoxic nephritis. Most of the beneficial
effects observed in the DDR1-null mice are attributed to reduced
inflammatory cell infiltration to the site of injury, suggesting
that DDR1 plays a pro-inflammatory effect. The goal of this study
was to determine whether, in addition to its pro-inflammatory
effect, DDR1 plays a deleterious effect in kidney injury by
directly regulating extracellular matrix production. We show that
DDR1-null mice have reduced deposition of glomerular collagens I
and IV as well as decreased proteinuria following the partial
renal ablation model of kidney injury. Using mesangial cells
isolated from DDR1-null mice, we show that these cells produce
significantly less collagen compared to DDR1-null cells
reconstituted with wild type DDR1. Moreover, mutagenesis analysis
revealed that mutations in the collagen binding site or in the
kinase domain significantly reduce DDR1-mediated collagen
production. Finally, we provide evidence that blocking DDR1
kinase activity with an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor
reduces collagen production. In conclusion, our studies indicate
that the kinase activity of DDR1 plays a key role in DDR1-induced
collagen synthesis and suggest that blocking collagen-mediated
DDR1 activation may be beneficial in fibrotic diseases.},
