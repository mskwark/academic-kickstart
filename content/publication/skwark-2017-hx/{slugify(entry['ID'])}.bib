 abstract = {Recent advances in the scale and diversity of population genomic
datasets for bacteria now provide the potential for genome-wide
patterns of co-evolution to be studied at the resolution of
individual bases. Here we describe a new statistical method,
genomeDCA, which uses recent advances in computational
structural biology to identify the polymorphic loci under the
strongest co-evolutionary pressures. We apply genomeDCA to two
large population data sets representing the major human
pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus). For pneumococcus
we identified 5,199 putative epistatic interactions between
1,936 sites. Over three-quarters of the links were between sites
within the pbp2x, pbp1a and pbp2b genes, the sequences of which
are critical in determining non-susceptibility to beta-lactam
antibiotics. A network-based analysis found these genes were
also coupled to that encoding dihydrofolate reductase, changes
to which underlie trimethoprim resistance. Distinct from these
antibiotic resistance genes, a large network component of 384
protein coding sequences encompassed many genes critical in
basic cellular functions, while another distinct component
included genes associated with virulence. The group A
Streptococcus (GAS) data set population represents a clonal
population with relatively little genetic variation and a high
level of linkage disequilibrium across the genome. Despite this,
we were able to pinpoint two RNA pseudouridine synthases, which
were each strongly linked to a separate set of loci across the
chromosome, representing biologically plausible targets of
co-selection. The population genomic analysis method applied
here identifies statistically significantly co-evolving locus
pairs, potentially arising from fitness selection
interdependence reflecting underlying protein-protein
interactions, or genes whose product activities contribute to
the same phenotype. This discovery approach greatly enhances the
future potential of epistasis analysis for systems biology, and
can complement genome-wide association studies as a means of
formulating hypotheses for targeted experimental work.},
