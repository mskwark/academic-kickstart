 abstract = {ABSTRACTOf the more than 190 distinct species of Mycobacterium
genus, many are economically and clinically important pathogens
of humans or animals. Among those mycobacteria that infect
humans, three species namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(causative agent of tuberculosis), Mycobacterium leprae
(causative agent of leprosy) and Mycobacterium abscessus
(causative agent of chronic pulmonary infections) pose concern
to global public health. Although antibiotics have been
successfully developed to combat each of these, the emergence of
drug-resistant strains is an increasing challenge for treatment
and drug discovery. Here we describe the impact of the rapid
expansion of genome sequencing and genome/pathway annotations
that have greatly improved the progress of structure-guided drug
discovery. We focus on the applications of comparative genomics,
metabolomics, evolutionary bioinformatics and structural
proteomics to identify potential drug targets. The opportunities
and challenges for the design of drugs for M. tuberculosis, M.
leprae and M. abscessus to combat resistance are discussed.},
