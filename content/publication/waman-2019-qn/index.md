abstract = "ABSTRACTOf the more than 190 distinct species of Mycobacteriumgenus, many are economically and clinically important pathogensof humans or animals. Among those mycobacteria that infecthumans, three species namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis(causative agent of tuberculosis), Mycobacterium leprae(causative agent of leprosy) and Mycobacterium abscessus(causative agent of chronic pulmonary infections) pose concernto global public health. Although antibiotics have beensuccessfully developed to combat each of these, the emergence ofdrug-resistant strains is an increasing challenge for treatmentand drug discovery. Here we describe the impact of the rapidexpansion of genome sequencing and genome/pathway annotationsthat have greatly improved the progress of structure-guided drugdiscovery. We focus on the applications of comparative genomics,metabolomics, evolutionary bioinformatics and structuralproteomics to identify potential drug targets. The opportunitiesand challenges for the design of drugs for M. tuberculosis, M.leprae and M. abscessus to combat resistance are discussed."
