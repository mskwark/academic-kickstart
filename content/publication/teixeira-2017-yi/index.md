abstract = "De novo membrane protein structure prediction is limited to smallproteins due to the conformational search space quickly expandingwith length. Long-range contacts (24+ amino acidseparation)-residue positions distant in sequence, but in closeproximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective wayto restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods forco-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-paircouplings that best explain the observed amino acidco-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarilyexplained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitiveeffects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approachesand custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact predictionaccuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, wedemonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding withBCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models foldedwas reduced by an average of 2 Ã… for a benchmark of 25membrane proteins."
