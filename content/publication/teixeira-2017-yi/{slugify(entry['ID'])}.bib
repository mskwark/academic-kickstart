 abstract = {De novo membrane protein structure prediction is limited to small
proteins due to the conformational search space quickly expanding
with length. Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid
separation)-residue positions distant in sequence, but in close
proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way
to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for
co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair
couplings that best explain the observed amino acid
co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily
explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive
effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches
and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction
accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6
percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we
demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with
BCL::Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded
was reduced by an average of 2 Ã… for a benchmark of 25
membrane proteins.},
