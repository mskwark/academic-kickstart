abstract = "Author Summary Here, we introduce a novel protein contactprediction method PconsC2 that, to the best of our knowledge,outperforms earlier methods. PconsC2 is based on our earliermethod, PconsC, as it utilizes the same set of contactpredictions from plmDCA and PSICOV. However, in contrast toPconsC, where each residue pair is analysed independently, theinitial predictions are analysed in context of neighbouringresidue pairs using a deep learning approach, inspired byearlier work. We find that for each layer the deep learningprocedure improves the predictions. At the end, after fivelayers of deep learning and inclusion of a few extra featuresprovides the best performance. An improvement can be seen forall types of proteins, independent on length, number ofhomologous sequences and structural class. However, theimprovement is largest for $Î²$-sheet containing proteins.Most importantly the improvement brings for the first timesufficiently accurate predictions to some protein families withless than 1000 homologous sequences. PconsC2 outperforms as wellstate of the art machine learning based predictors for proteinfamilies larger than 100 effective sequences.
