 abstract = {Author Summary Here, we introduce a novel protein contact
prediction method PconsC2 that, to the best of our knowledge,
outperforms earlier methods. PconsC2 is based on our earlier
method, PconsC, as it utilizes the same set of contact
predictions from plmDCA and PSICOV. However, in contrast to
PconsC, where each residue pair is analysed independently, the
initial predictions are analysed in context of neighbouring
residue pairs using a deep learning approach, inspired by
earlier work. We find that for each layer the deep learning
procedure improves the predictions. At the end, after five
layers of deep learning and inclusion of a few extra features
provides the best performance. An improvement can be seen for
all types of proteins, independent on length, number of
homologous sequences and structural class. However, the
improvement is largest for $Î²$-sheet containing proteins.
Most importantly the improvement brings for the first time
sufficiently accurate predictions to some protein families with
less than 1000 homologous sequences. PconsC2 outperforms as well
state of the art machine learning based predictors for protein
families larger than 100 effective sequences. PconsC2 is
