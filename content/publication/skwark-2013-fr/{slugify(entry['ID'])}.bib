 abstract = {SUMMARY: Recently, several new contact prediction methods have
been published. They use (i) large sets of multiple aligned
sequences and (ii) assume that correlations between columns in
these alignments can be the results of indirect interaction.
These methods are clearly superior to earlier methods when it
comes to predicting contacts in proteins. Here, we demonstrate
that combining predictions from two prediction methods, PSICOV
and plmDCA, and two alignment methods, HHblits and jackhmmer at
four different e-value cut-offs, provides a relative improvement
of 20% in comparison with the best single method, exceeding 70%
correct predictions for one contact prediction per residue.
