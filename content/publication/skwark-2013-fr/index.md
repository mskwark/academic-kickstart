abstract = "SUMMARY: Recently, several new contact prediction methods havebeen published. They use (i) large sets of multiple alignedsequences and (ii) assume that correlations between columns inthese alignments can be the results of indirect interaction.These methods are clearly superior to earlier methods when itcomes to predicting contacts in proteins. Here, we demonstratethat combining predictions from two prediction methods, PSICOVand plmDCA, and two alignment methods, HHblits and jackhmmer atfour different e-value cut-offs, provides a relative improvementof 20% in comparison with the best single method, exceeding 70%correct predictions for one contact prediction per residue.AVAILABILITY: The source code for PconsC along with supplementarydata is freely available at http://c.pcons.net/ CONTACT:arne@bioinfo.se SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data areavailable at Bioinformatics online."
