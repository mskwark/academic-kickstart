abstract = "SUMMARY: SPOCTOPUS is a method for combined prediction of signalpeptides and membrane protein topology, suitable for genome-scalestudies. Its objective is to minimize false predictions oftransmembrane regions as signal peptides and vice versa. Weprovide a description of the SPOCTOPUS algorithm together with aperformance evaluation where SPOCTOPUS compares favorably withstate-of-the-art methods for signal peptide and topologypredictions. AVAILABILITY: SPOCTOPUS is available as a web serverand both the source code and benchmark data are available fordownload at http://octopus.cbr.su.se/"
