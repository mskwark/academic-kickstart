 abstract = {SUMMARY: SPOCTOPUS is a method for combined prediction of signal
peptides and membrane protein topology, suitable for genome-scale
studies. Its objective is to minimize false predictions of
transmembrane regions as signal peptides and vice versa. We
provide a description of the SPOCTOPUS algorithm together with a
performance evaluation where SPOCTOPUS compares favorably with
state-of-the-art methods for signal peptide and topology
predictions. AVAILABILITY: SPOCTOPUS is available as a web server
and both the source code and benchmark data are available for
download at http://octopus.cbr.su.se/},
