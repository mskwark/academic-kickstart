abstract = "Intracellular vesicles are abundant in eukaryotic cells butabsent in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However,strong overexpression of a monotopic glycolipid-synthesizingenzyme, monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from Acholeplasmalaidlawii (alMGS), leads to massive formation of vesicles in thecytoplasm of E. coli. More importantly, alMGS provides a modelsystem for the regulation of membrane properties bymembrane-bound enzymes, which is critical for maintainingcellular integrity. Both phenomena depend on how alMGS binds tocell membranes, which is not well understood. Here, we carry outa comprehensive investigation of the membrane binding of alMGS bycombining bioinformatics methods with extensive biochemicalstudies, structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations.We find that alMGS binds to the membrane in a fairly uprightmanner, mainly by residues in the N-terminal domain, and in a waythat induces local enrichment of anionic lipids and a localcurvature deformation. Furthermore, several alMGS variantsresulting from substitution of residues in the membrane anchoringsegment are still able to generate vesicles, regardless ofenzymatic activity. These results clarify earlier theories aboutthe driving forces for vesicle formation, and shed new light onthe membrane binding properties and enzymatic mechanism of alMGSand related monotopic GT-B fold glycosyltransferases."
