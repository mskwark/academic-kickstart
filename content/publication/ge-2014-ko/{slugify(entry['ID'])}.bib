 abstract = {Intracellular vesicles are abundant in eukaryotic cells but
absent in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However,
strong overexpression of a monotopic glycolipid-synthesizing
enzyme, monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from Acholeplasma
laidlawii (alMGS), leads to massive formation of vesicles in the
cytoplasm of E. coli. More importantly, alMGS provides a model
system for the regulation of membrane properties by
membrane-bound enzymes, which is critical for maintaining
cellular integrity. Both phenomena depend on how alMGS binds to
cell membranes, which is not well understood. Here, we carry out
a comprehensive investigation of the membrane binding of alMGS by
combining bioinformatics methods with extensive biochemical
studies, structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations.
We find that alMGS binds to the membrane in a fairly upright
manner, mainly by residues in the N-terminal domain, and in a way
that induces local enrichment of anionic lipids and a local
curvature deformation. Furthermore, several alMGS variants
resulting from substitution of residues in the membrane anchoring
segment are still able to generate vesicles, regardless of
enzymatic activity. These results clarify earlier theories about
the driving forces for vesicle formation, and shed new light on
the membrane binding properties and enzymatic mechanism of alMGS
and related monotopic GT-B fold glycosyltransferases.},
