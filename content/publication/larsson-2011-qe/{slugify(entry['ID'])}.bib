 abstract = {UNLABELLED: Multiple templates can often be used to build more
accurate homology models than models built from a single
template. Here we introduce PconsM, an automated protocol that
uses multiple templates to build protein models. PconsM has been
among the top-performing methods in the recent CASP experiments
and consistently perform better than the single template models
used in Pcons.net. In particular for the easier targets with many
alternative templates with a high degree of sequence identity,
quality is readily improved with a few percentages over the
highest ranked model built on a single template. PconsM is
available as an additional pipeline within the Pcons.net protein
structure prediction server. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
PconsM is freely available from http://pcons.net/.},
