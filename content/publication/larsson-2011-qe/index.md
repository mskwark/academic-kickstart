abstract = "UNLABELLED: Multiple templates can often be used to build moreaccurate homology models than models built from a singletemplate. Here we introduce PconsM, an automated protocol thatuses multiple templates to build protein models. PconsM has beenamong the top-performing methods in the recent CASP experimentsand consistently perform better than the single template modelsused in Pcons.net. In particular for the easier targets with manyalternative templates with a high degree of sequence identity,quality is readily improved with a few percentages over thehighest ranked model built on a single template. PconsM isavailable as an additional pipeline within the Pcons.net proteinstructure prediction server. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:PconsM is freely available from http://pcons.net/."
