 abstract = {SUMMARY: Clustering methods are often needed for accurately
assessing the quality of modeled protein structures. Recent blind
evaluation of quality assessment methods in CASP10 showed that
there is little difference between many different methods as far
as ranking models and selecting best model are concerned. When
comparing many models, the computational cost of the model
comparison can become significant. Here, we present PconsD, a
fast, stream-computing method for distance-driven model quality
assessment that runs on consumer hardware. PconsD is at least one
order of magnitude faster than other methods of comparable
accuracy. AVAILABILITY: The source code for PconsD is freely
available at http://d.pcons.net/. Supplementary benchmarking data
are also available there. CONTACT: arne@bioinfo.se SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics
online.},
