abstract = "SUMMARY: Clustering methods are often needed for accuratelyassessing the quality of modeled protein structures. Recent blindevaluation of quality assessment methods in CASP10 showed thatthere is little difference between many different methods as faras ranking models and selecting best model are concerned. Whencomparing many models, the computational cost of the modelcomparison can become significant. Here, we present PconsD, afast, stream-computing method for distance-driven model qualityassessment that runs on consumer hardware. PconsD is at least oneorder of magnitude faster than other methods of comparableaccuracy. AVAILABILITY: The source code for PconsD is freelyavailable at http://d.pcons.net/. Supplementary benchmarking dataare also available there. CONTACT: arne@bioinfo.se SUPPLEMENTARYINFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline."
