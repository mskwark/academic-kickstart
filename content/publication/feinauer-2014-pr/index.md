abstract = "Correlation patterns in multiple sequence alignments ofhomologous proteins can be exploited to infer information on thethree-dimensional structure of their members. The typicalpipeline to address this task, which we in this paper refer to asthe three dimensions of contact prediction, is to: (i) filter andalign the raw sequence data representing the evolutionarilyrelated proteins; (ii) choose a predictive model to describe asequence alignment; (iii) infer the model parameters andinterpret them in terms of structural properties, such as anaccurate contact map. We show here that all three dimensions areimportant for overall prediction success. In particular, we showthat it is possible to improve significantly along the seconddimension by going beyond the pair-wise Potts models fromstatistical physics, which have hitherto been the focus of thefield. These (simple) extensions are motivated by multiplesequence alignments often containing long stretches of gapswhich, as a data feature, would be rather untypical forindependent samples drawn from a Potts model. Using a large testset of proteins we show that the combined improvements along thethree dimensions are as large as any reported to date."
