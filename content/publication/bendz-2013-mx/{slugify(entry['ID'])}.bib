 abstract = {Topology analysis of membrane proteins can be obtained by
enzymatic shaving in combination with MS identification of
peptides. Ideally, such analysis could provide quite detailed
information about the membrane spanning regions. Here, we examine
the ability of some shaving enzymes to provide large-scale
analysis of membrane proteome topologies. To compare different
shaving enzymes, we first analyzed the detected peptides from two
over-expressed proteins. Second, we analyzed the peptides from
non-over-expressed Escherichia coli membrane proteins with known
structure to evaluate the shaving methods. Finally, the
identified peptides were used to test the accuracy of a number of
topology predictors. At the end we suggest that the usage of
thermolysin, an enzyme working at the natural pH of the cell for
membrane shaving, is superior because: (i) we detect a similar
number of peptides and proteins using thermolysin and trypsin;
(ii) thermolysin shaving can be run at a natural pH and (iii) the
incubation time is quite short. (iv) Fewer detected peptides from
thermolysin shaving originate from the transmembrane regions.
Using thermolysin shaving we can also provide a clear separation
between the best and the less accurate topology predictors,
indicating that using data from shaving can provide valuable
information when developing new topology predictors.},
