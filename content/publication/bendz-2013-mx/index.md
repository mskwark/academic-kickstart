abstract = "Topology analysis of membrane proteins can be obtained byenzymatic shaving in combination with MS identification ofpeptides. Ideally, such analysis could provide quite detailedinformation about the membrane spanning regions. Here, we examinethe ability of some shaving enzymes to provide large-scaleanalysis of membrane proteome topologies. To compare differentshaving enzymes, we first analyzed the detected peptides from twoover-expressed proteins. Second, we analyzed the peptides fromnon-over-expressed Escherichia coli membrane proteins with knownstructure to evaluate the shaving methods. Finally, theidentified peptides were used to test the accuracy of a number oftopology predictors. At the end we suggest that the usage ofthermolysin, an enzyme working at the natural pH of the cell formembrane shaving, is superior because: (i) we detect a similarnumber of peptides and proteins using thermolysin and trypsin;(ii) thermolysin shaving can be run at a natural pH and (iii) theincubation time is quite short. (iv) Fewer detected peptides fromthermolysin shaving originate from the transmembrane regions.Using thermolysin shaving we can also provide a clear separationbetween the best and the less accurate topology predictors,indicating that using data from shaving can provide valuableinformation when developing new topology predictors."
