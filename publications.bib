                   dictated by structure, since it is by spatial interactions
                   that molecules interact with each other, both in terms of
                   steric complementarity, as well as intermolecular forces.
                   Thus, the electron density field and electrostatic potential
                   field of a molecule contain the ``raw fingerprint'' of how
                   this molecule can fit to binding partners. In this paper, we

                   based on EC numbers is predicted from the approximated

                   of small molecules is predicted with quality comparable to

               prediction method PconsC2 that, to the best of our knowledge,
               outperforms earlier methods. PconsC2 is based on our earlier
               method, PconsC, as it utilizes the same set of contact
               predictions from plmDCA and PSICOV. However, in contrast to
               PconsC, where each residue pair is analysed independently, the
               initial predictions are analysed in context of neighbouring
               residue pairs using a deep learning approach, inspired by
               earlier work. We find that for each layer the deep learning
               procedure improves the predictions. At the end, after five
               layers of deep learning and inclusion of a few extra features
               provides the best performance. An improvement can be seen for
               all types of proteins, independent on length, number of
               homologous sequences and structural class. However, the
               improvement is largest for $\beta$-sheet containing proteins.
               Most importantly the improvement brings for the first time
               sufficiently accurate predictions to some protein families with
               less than 1000 homologous sequences. PconsC2 outperforms as well
               state of the art machine learning based predictors for protein
               families larger than 100 effective sequences. PconsC2 is

              protein contact prediction from evolutionary information can be
              improved significantly if direct and indirect information is
              separated. Given sufficiently large protein families, the contact
              predictions contain sufficient information to predict the
              structure of many protein families. However, since the first
              studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we ask
              how much the final models are improved if improved contact
              predictions are used. RESULTS: In a small benchmark of 15
              proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models are
              improved by on average 33\% using PconsFold compared with the
              original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find that
              the quality is improved with 15-30\% when using PconsC in
              comparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further,
              using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve
              global model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated with
              Rosetta is improved. AVAILABILITY: PconsFold is a fully automated
              pipeline for ab initio protein structure prediction based on
              evolutionary information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contact
              prediction and uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to its
              modularity, the contact prediction tool can be easily exchanged.

              pipeline to address this task, which we in this paper refer to as
              the three dimensions of contact prediction, is to: (i) filter and
              align the raw sequence data representing the evolutionarily
              related proteins; (ii) choose a predictive model to describe a

              statistical physics, which have hitherto been the focus of the

              independent samples drawn from a Potts model. Using a large test

              with two predictors that predict both global and local quality

              MQAP is 0.68 showing that there is still clear room for

  abstract = "Intracellular vesicles are abundant in eukaryotic cells but
              absent in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However,
              strong overexpression of a monotopic glycolipid-synthesizing
              enzyme, monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from Acholeplasma
              laidlawii (alMGS), leads to massive formation of vesicles in the
              cytoplasm of E. coli. More importantly, alMGS provides a model
              system for the regulation of membrane properties by
              membrane-bound enzymes, which is critical for maintaining
              cellular integrity. Both phenomena depend on how alMGS binds to
              cell membranes, which is not well understood. Here, we carry out
              a comprehensive investigation of the membrane binding of alMGS by
              combining bioinformatics methods with extensive biochemical
              studies, structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations.
              We find that alMGS binds to the membrane in a fairly upright
              manner, mainly by residues in the N-terminal domain, and in a way
              that induces local enrichment of anionic lipids and a local
              curvature deformation. Furthermore, several alMGS variants
              resulting from substitution of residues in the membrane anchoring
              segment are still able to generate vesicles, regardless of
              enzymatic activity. These results clarify earlier theories about
              the driving forces for vesicle formation, and shed new light on
              the membrane binding properties and enzymatic mechanism of alMGS
              and related monotopic GT-B fold glycosyltransferases.",

              uses multiple templates to build protein models. PconsM has been
              among the top-performing methods in the recent CASP experiments
              and consistently perform better than the single template models
              used in Pcons.net. In particular for the easier targets with many
              alternative templates with a high degree of sequence identity,
              quality is readily improved with a few percentages over the
              highest ranked model built on a single template. PconsM is
              available as an additional pipeline within the Pcons.net protein

              information about the membrane spanning regions. Here, we examine
              the ability of some shaving enzymes to provide large-scale
              analysis of membrane proteome topologies. To compare different
              shaving enzymes, we first analyzed the detected peptides from two
              over-expressed proteins. Second, we analyzed the peptides from
              non-over-expressed Escherichia coli membrane proteins with known
              structure to evaluate the shaving methods. Finally, the
              identified peptides were used to test the accuracy of a number of
              topology predictors. At the end we suggest that the usage of
              thermolysin, an enzyme working at the natural pH of the cell for
              membrane shaving, is superior because: (i) we detect a similar
              number of peptides and proteins using thermolysin and trypsin;
              (ii) thermolysin shaving can be run at a natural pH and (iii) the
              incubation time is quite short. (iv) Fewer detected peptides from
              thermolysin shaving originate from the transmembrane regions.
              Using thermolysin shaving we can also provide a clear separation
              between the best and the less accurate topology predictors,
              indicating that using data from shaving can provide valuable
              information when developing new topology predictors.",

              proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way
              to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for

  abstract = "Motivation: A few years ago it was shown that by using a maximum
              entropy approach to describe couplings between columns in a
              multiple sequence alignment it is possible to significantly
              increase the accuracy of residue contact predictions. For very
              large protein families with more than 1000 effective sequences
              the accuracy is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteins
              as well as complexes. Today, for about half of all Pfam domain
              families no structure is known, but unfortunately most of these
              families have at most a few hundred members, i.e. are too small
              for such contact prediction methods. Results: To extend accurate
              contact predictions to the thousands of smaller protein families
              we present PconsC3, a fast and improved method for protein
              contact predictions that can be used for families with even 100
              effective sequence members. PconsC3 outperforms direct coupling
              analysis (DCA) methods significantly independent on family size,
              secondary structure content, contact range, or the number of
              selected contacts. Availability and implementation: PconsC3 is
              available as a web server and downloadable version at

              increases following kidney injury and accumulating evidence
              suggests that it contributes to the progression of injury. To
              this end, deletion of DDR1 is beneficial in ameliorating kidney
              injury induced by angiotensin infusion, unilateral ureteral
              obstruction, or nephrotoxic nephritis. Most of the beneficial
              effects observed in the DDR1-null mice are attributed to reduced
              inflammatory cell infiltration to the site of injury, suggesting
              that DDR1 plays a pro-inflammatory effect. The goal of this study
              was to determine whether, in addition to its pro-inflammatory
              effect, DDR1 plays a deleterious effect in kidney injury by
              directly regulating extracellular matrix production. We show that
              DDR1-null mice have reduced deposition of glomerular collagens I
              and IV as well as decreased proteinuria following the partial
              renal ablation model of kidney injury. Using mesangial cells
              isolated from DDR1-null mice, we show that these cells produce
              significantly less collagen compared to DDR1-null cells
              reconstituted with wild type DDR1. Moreover, mutagenesis analysis
              revealed that mutations in the collagen binding site or in the
              kinase domain significantly reduce DDR1-mediated collagen
              production. Finally, we provide evidence that blocking DDR1
              kinase activity with an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor
              reduces collagen production. In conclusion, our studies indicate
              that the kinase activity of DDR1 plays a key role in DDR1-induced
              collagen synthesis and suggest that blocking collagen-mediated
              DDR1 activation may be beneficial in fibrotic diseases.",
